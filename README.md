- Marks between 50 and 59: Grade C
- Marks between 40 and 49: Grade D
- Marks below 40: Grade E

After checking the marks, it will display the grade on the console.

# Fast X

Fast X is a JavaScript program that calculates demerit points for a car based on its speed. The program applies a demerit point system and provides appropriate outputs based on the given conditions. 

## Usage

To use Speed Demerit Points, follow these steps:

1. Open the JavaScript console in your web browser.
2. Copy and paste the provided JavaScript code into the console.
3. Press Enter to execute the code.

## How it works

The program prompts the user to enter the speed of the car in kilometers per hour (km/h) using a dialog box. Please ensure you enter a valid integer representing the car's speed. 

After receiving the user's input, Speed Demerit Points evaluates the car's speed and determines the demerit points based on the following criteria:

- If the speed is below the speed limit of 70 km/h, the program outputs "Ok".
- If the speed exceeds the speed limit, the program calculates the demerit points by subtracting the speed limit from the actual speed and dividing the difference by the rate of kilometers per demerit point (5 km). It then outputs the number of demerit points as "Points: X", where X represents the calculated demerit points.
- If the calculated demerit points exceed the maximum allowed demerit points (12), the program outputs "License suspended".

## Example

Here's an example:

Enter the speed of the car (in km/h): 90
Points: 4

In this case, the user entered a car speed of 90 km/h, and the program determined that it corresponds to 4 demerit points.

Enter the speed of the car (in km/h): 120
License suspended

 The car speed of 120 km/h, exceeding the speed limit and resulting in a license suspension.

## Limitations

Fast X is a basic program created to show how JavaScript can be used for calculating speed. It doesn't have fancy features like saving data or fancy interfaces. It's best used for as a starting point for learning javaScript.

# Salary Calculator

The Salary Calculator is a simple JavaScript program that helps you calculate your salary. You just need to enter your basic salary and any additional benefits you receive, and it will calculate your gross salary, deductions, and net salary.

## How to Use

To use the Salary Calculator, follow these steps:

1. Open your web browser's JavaScript console.
2. Copy and paste the provided JavaScript code into the console.
3. Press Enter to see the results.
4. Enter your basic salary when prompted.
5. Enter the total amount of benefits you receive when prompted.

## How It Works

When you run the Salary Calculator, it asks you to enter your basic salary and benefits. It then calculates your gross salary by adding your basic salary, benefits, and a predefined constant basic salary.

Next, it calculates the deductions based on the gross salary using predefined rates for tax, NHIF, and NSSF. The deductions are a percentage of the gross salary.

Finally, it calculates your net salary by subtracting the total deductions from the gross salary.

The program displays the results, including your gross salary, tax deduction, NHIF deduction, NSSF deduction, and net salary.

## Example

Here's an example:

Enter your basic salary: 50000
Enter the total amount of benefits received: 10000

A basic salary of 50,000 and benefits of 10,000. The program calculates your gross salary, deductions, and net salary based on the provided values and predefined rates. The results will be displayed as follows:
Your Gross Salary is: 305000.00
Your Tax deduction is: 91500.00
Your NHIF deduction is: 7625.00
Your NSSF deduction is: 18300.00
